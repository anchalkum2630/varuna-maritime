# Reflection on AI Agent Usage

During this project, I learned how AI agents like ChatGPT and Gemini can significantly speed up development while providing guidance on complex functionality. I used these tools to understand core logic, generate boilerplate code, and create initial implementations for both backend and frontend components. This helped me focus on higher-level design decisions, such as domain modeling and clean architecture, rather than repetitive coding tasks.

Using AI agents provided notable efficiency gains. Tasks like generating TypeScript functions, React components, and API structures were much faster compared to manual coding. I was also able to handle error-checking and edge cases more quickly by leveraging AI suggestions, which saved time during testing and debugging.

However, I observed that AI outputs are not always perfect. There were instances of SQL syntax errors, incorrect CORS headers, or minor logic issues that required manual review. This highlighted the importance of validating AI-generated code and not relying solely on it.

Next time, I would focus on a more structured workflow with AI agents. For example, using ChatGPT for logic and formula explanations, Gemini for generating boilerplate, and manual verification in parallel could streamline the process even further. I would also maintain a clearer record of prompts and corrections to make the workflow reproducible and easier to debug.

Overall, AI agents greatly enhanced my productivity, especially in writing boilerplate and error-handling code, while reinforcing the need for careful review and validation.
